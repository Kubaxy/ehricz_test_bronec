{{< intro >}}


The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project (EHRI) provides online access to information about dispersed sources relating to the Holocaust and makes these documents and resources more accessible. EHRI is funded by the European Commission under the FP7 and Horizon 2020 programmes.

Czech EHRI node has become part of the [LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ](https://www.lindat.cz/) infrastructure in 2023. The partners of the Czech EHRI consortium are: [Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.mua.cas.cz/en), the [National Archives](https://www.nacr.cz/en/), [Terezín Memorial](https://www.pamatnik-terezin.cz/?lang=en) and the [Terezín Initiative Institute](http://www.terezinstudies.cz/en/).

### EHRI-CZ will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within the Czech republic and beyond by:

 * representing institutions within the Czech republic which contain materials related to Holocaust
   Studies to create a strong research consortium;
 * connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;
 * developing innovative digital research tools;
 * offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists, and heritage professionals.

EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider
social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
Europe and beyond.
