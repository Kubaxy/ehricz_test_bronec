{{< intro >}}
The MemoGIS historical geographic information system superimposes data on more than 30,000 victims of the Holocaust, places of persecution, the shrinking public space of the time period, and the cityâ€™s other inhabitants onto an interactive map of Prague. MemoGIS is designed as a mobile web application that allows users to conduct research not only from their homes or school computers, but also from their mobile phones while walking in the city.
